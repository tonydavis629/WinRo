Window Cleaning Robot - 2016 Mechanical Engineering Senior Capstone Project at Ohio State University

This repo holds some arduino code for my senior capstone design project at Ohio State. We designed and built a robot that was cable suspended and used worm gear motors to navigate itself around the window in order to clean it. The cleaning mechanism was a set of two compliant four-bar mechanisms with some spinning dusters attached on the end. In the end, it didn't work great because the power requirement from the worm gears was dependent on the cables' angle, and we didn't have the time to design a control system to manage that.
